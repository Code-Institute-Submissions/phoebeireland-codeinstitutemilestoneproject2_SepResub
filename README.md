## Design Choices


### Font


### Icons


### Colours
The main colours used on the site are:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 


### Styling


### Images



## Wireframe Designs
The Wireframe designs were created in a notebook using a pencil, and the following images are photos taken from the notebook. As they are handwritten, some of the writing may not be fully legible to all readers. To combat this, I have added a typed description of all pages below the image. Please refer to those if needed.  

Please keep in mind that the drawings were the first stage of the design. and the actual website may look somewhat different from the drawings. Where the two differ, I offer an explanation as to why.
